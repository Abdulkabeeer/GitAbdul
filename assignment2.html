    Dear Eileen,
    
    <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's Science Faculty
        to study as part of your PhD next year.<br>
         I will answer your question's one by one in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Starting dates
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better 
        if you could start at the beginning <br>
        of a semester.The start days for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First Semester: 9 September, 2016 
        </li>

    <h2>
        Subjects of Study
    </h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects 
        fall under the realm of science and <br>technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher and
        just the type of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas <br>you submitted, we were
        most intrigued by the following, in order of priority. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol 
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C
             (86<sup>o</sup>F) when the audience size exponentially <br>increases
             (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML and CSS construct for representing musical scores.
        </li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research
     to take, required staff and other <br>resources, and anything else you'd think we need to know? Thanks.

        Exotic dance moves
    </h2>
     Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your 
     question, my favorite dances are as follows, with <br>definition:
     
     <p>Polynesian Chicken dance</p>
     <blockquote> A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance, dating as far back as 300BC; a whole village will dance around
     in a circle like chickens, to encourage the livestock <br> to be 'fruitful'. <br> </blockquote>
     <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
     <blockquote>The icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance; which involved 
     huddling close together in a circle on the <br> floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very
     rapid movements. One of my students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> modern styles such as Twerking.<br></blockquote>
     <p>Artic robot dance</p>
     <blockquote>Interesting example of historian misinformation, English explorers in the 1960's believed to have discovered a new
     dance style characterised by "robotic" <br> stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
     Later on however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br> because they were really cold. <br></blockquote>
      <br>

      Yours sincerely, <br>
